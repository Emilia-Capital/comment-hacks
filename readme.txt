Make comments management easier by applying the simple hacks Joost has gathered over the years.

== Description ==

Make comments management easier by applying the simple hacks Joost has gathered over the years.

This plugin adds some small hacks around core WordPress comments to make them more bearable:

* Cleaner comment notification emails.
* The option to enforce a comment policy: just create a comment policy page, toggle the option on and select it, and
commenters will have to accept your comment policy before being able to comment.
* The option to forward comments to an email address (for instance for your support team) and then trash them.
* The option to disallow comments below and above a certain length.
* The option to redirect first time commenters to a "thank you" page.
* An input field on the comment edit screen to change the comment parent ID.
* Links in the admin comments section to email individual commenters.
* A button in the WP toolbar to email all the commenters on a post.
* Adds a comment routing option. This adds a dropdown in a post's discussion settings, allowing the routing of comment emails to another user.

See the screenshots to get an even better idea of the plugins' functionality.
