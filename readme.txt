== Description ==

Make comments management easier by applying some of the simple hacks the Yoast team uses.

This plugin adds some small hacks around core WordPress comments to make them more bearable:

* Cleaner comment notification emails.
* The option to disallow comments below a certain length.
* The option to redirect first time commenters to a thank you page.
* An input field on the comment edit screen to change the comment parent ID.
* Links in the admin comments section to email individual commenters.
* A button in the WP toolbar to email all the commenters on a post.
* Adds a comment routing option. This adds a dropdown in a post's discussion settings, allowing the routing of comment emails to another user.

See the screenshots to get an even better idea of the plugins functionality.
