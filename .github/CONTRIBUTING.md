#### Fixing an issue

* Fork the repository on GitHub (make sure to use the `develop` branch).
* Make the changes to your forked repository.
* Ensure you stick to the [WordPress Coding Standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/coding-standards/) and you properly document any new functions, actions and filters following the [documentation standards](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/best-practices/inline-documentation-standards/php/).

We will review your pull request and merge when everything is in order. We will help you to make sure the code complies with the standards described above.

#### 'Patch welcome' issues
